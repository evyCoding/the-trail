Is this your first PCB:
  yES, and I have a good feeling about it we can make anything happend

What you are making?
  we will be making a device which can help us:
    -keep dangerous animals away.
    -attract friendlnimals to pet them / have nice pictures
  we will be making the PCB consiste of a micro-controller so it can read voices from a usb and then run the audio on the speaker:
    1st week: learn About PCB's and design our own
    2nd week: buy the extra parts such as batteries and other stuff before the PCB is shipped
    3rd week: we will code the micro-controller so it can display every voice and to make the buttons work
    4th week: setup every thing and test our final product

  While hiking many hikers face some dangerous animals so why not make it more secure for them and keep the hiker and animal safe :)
